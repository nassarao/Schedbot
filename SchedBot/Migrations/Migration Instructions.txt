Making migrations is really easy.
If you want to update the database simply create the change in the DTOs.
Make the necessary update to SchedbotContext if needed
run commands in Tools>NugetPackageManger>Package Manager Console
first command: Add-Migration AddUser
	 (Adduser is just a name for the migration)
Second: Update-Database
	 command to apply the new migration to the database
